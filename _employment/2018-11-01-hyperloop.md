After MSc graduation, decided to stay in the US and continue my work at Hyperloop. I worked for Machine Intelligence Team, Data Automation & Insights group, focused on generative transportation system design. I was wearing many hats: Software Architect, Back-End, Data Engineer.

- designed and co-developed cloud simulation run tool written in golang(run&monitor) and python(analyze), using EC2, MLflow and Databricks. Allowed for massively scaled simulation & batch results (e.g. running and analyzing thousands of paralllel, hours-long simulations running on EC2/S3).
- developed advanced simulation metrics in python and dashboards, allowing C-level executives to summarize simulation runs and get actionable insights about Hyperloop system design for a given location.
- increased speed 150x for python analytics code by using cloud-based Spark and koalas package,
- trained & deployed 3 demand prediction models using keras & Horovod, ARIMA, Prophet. Researched the effect of weather, events, holidays on transportation demand. Improved Hyperloop capacity utilization by 70% (in simulation).
- presented my teams work at conferences, blog-posts & webinars, reaching > 50k technical viewers.

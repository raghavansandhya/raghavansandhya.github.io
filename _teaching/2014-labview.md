Propagating the knowledge I got from [the summer internship at NI](/employment/2014-07-01-ni) to other students. Organised by me, materials prepared by NI. I ran multiple weekly 3-month-length prep classes to get students to pass the CLAD exam (NI certification). More than 200 people came to my classes and many succesfully passed the exam.
